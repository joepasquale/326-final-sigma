Our application is a website which allows one to sign up and store books that they have read, will read, or plan to read. They can add things that are required like Author, genre, title, etc while some things might be optional to add, like the book picture, your rating, a review, etc. People can share their "shelves" with other people when they friend them and they can comment on a review a friend has given. 
After we posted our idea in slack, it was brought to our attention that goodreads.com is similar to our idea. Upon further inspection, it seems that many people say there are multiple problems with goodreads.com which we can fix/improve with our website.

The main complaints that we are seeing refer to the goodreads.com's review and ratings, which we will improve on over the semester.
