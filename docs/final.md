## Team Sigma
### Application: [Shelf](https://limitless-garden-19995.herokuapp.com/)
### Spring 2020

## Overview
Our proposed application is a website which allows a user to sign up and store books that they are currently reading, have read, or plan to read. They can search for books which are fetched from the Google Books API, which will return basic information about the book, such as title, author, and publisher, as well as more detailed information, such as cover art and Google Books rating. When users add a book to a list, they are also able to add a personal rating and review. Users can share their "shelves" with other people when they add them as a friend, and they can comment on reviews from members of their friends list, which show up in a feed. It was brought to our attention that our concept was very similar to [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com); however, many users of the site say there are multiple problems with the platform, ranging from performance issues to discontent with the rating system. We believe that Shelf does a good job at alleviating some of the issues that GoodReads has been criticized for.
