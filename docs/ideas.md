## Innovative Idea
Our proposed application is a website which allows a user to sign up and store books that they are currently reading, have read, or plan to read. They can add information about the book to help categorize it, such as title, author, genre, ISBN, etc; there would also be information that would be optional to add, like the book's cover art, your rating, a review, etc. People can share their "shelves" with other people when they add them as a friend, them and they can comment on reviews from members of their friends list.  After we posted our idea in the Slack message board, it was brought to our group's attention that the exisiting website https://www.goodreads.com is similar to our idea. Upon further inspection, it seems that many users of the site say there are multiple problems with the platform. We are aiming to fix, improve, or redesign these design flaws with Shelf.

The main complaints that users of Goodreads have refer to the review and rating system, which we will improve on over the semester. Many users also complain about the stability of the application itself, stating that 
> The app crashes often and is slow in general.
We aim to make a more stable and quick application by the end of the semester.

## Important Components
-Users will be able to add a book to one of three lists: "Have Read", "Currently Reading", and "Will Read".
-Users will be able to add a book to their profile by inputting some critical information. These books will be pushed to a database, so that if another user was to try and log the same book, it would show up for them too.
-Users will be able to write reviews for books (in a similar fashion to how users make posts on Facebook), and will also be able to write comments on friends' reviews.
-Users will be able to add other users as 'friends' and will be able to view their friend's reading lists and review history.
